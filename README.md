### current_mirror 
A current mirror consists of at least two transistors (usually bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) or metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs)) arranged in such a way that the current flowing through one transistor (the reference transistor) is mirrored by the other transistor(s) (the output transistor(s)).<br>
A MOSFET current mirror works similarly to a BJT current mirror. However, instead of the base-emitter voltage, the MOSFET current mirror relies on the gate-source voltage (Vgs) to establish the current. The gate-source voltage of both MOSFETs in the mirror is set equal, and by matching their dimensions and ensuring proper biasing, the output current in the mirrored transistor will be a copy of the reference current.<br>
## Types of Current Mirrors<br>
Simple Current Mirror: This is the basic current mirror configuration, where two transistors are used to mirror the current. It works well for moderate precision but suffers from issues like output impedance and variations due to mismatches in the transistors.<br>
Wilson Current Mirror: The Wilson current mirror is a more advanced version that improves output impedance and accuracy by adding additional transistors to provide better current mirroring performance.<br>
Cascode Current Mirror: The cascode current mirror uses an additional transistor to improve output resistance and make the current mirror less sensitive to changes in the load. This version has better performance in high-impedance environments.<br>
Improved Current Mirrors (e.g., Vbe-multiplier, etc.): These designs attempt to minimize the effects of transistor mismatch, temperature variations, and other real-world imperfections to provide more accurate and stable current mirrors.<br>
## applications of Current Mirrors<br>
Biasing: Current mirrors are frequently used to set bias currents in amplifier stages and other analog circuits, ensuring stable and predictable performance.<br>
Current Sources: They can act as precise current sources, which are useful in analog signal processing, active filters, and voltage-controlled current sources.<br>
Active Loads: Current mirrors are used in differential amplifier stages to provide a high output impedance, making them useful in increasing the gain of the amplifier.<br>
